#### Commit rules

##### title

Title of the commit must be a short explanation of the work done. It should never only be words like “fix” because it does not describe the work done at all.

##### comment

The comment of the commit must explain the work done in detail. It can contain a checklist as well (very easy with markdown syntax).

##### link with trello

On the project management tool Trello, in the task associated with the commit, the developer must link every of his commits he has done for the task.
